      <p>
        Constantly on the hunt for more growth in the world of tech in order to
        add to my increasing knowledge within the tech field. Always looking for
        motivation to continue growing outside my means and crossing paths with
        like-minded individuals who are aiming to seek greatness.

      <h3>
        "In order to live life to the fullest you must be in uncomfortable
        positions. To grow means to adapt to changes whether good or bad. To
        deprive yourself of growth means to remain where you are without change.
        Choose change. Choose to live." - Keith
