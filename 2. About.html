      <h3>Art is Life</h3>
      <p>
        Drawing has always been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.
        As a child my mother always told me it was how I originally communicated
        to others due to me having a speech impediment. Even after I learning to
        talk art has always stuck with me throughout the years either by me
        creating my own or being exposed to other individuals works of art.

      <h3>Video Games</h3>
      <p>
        For as long as I can remember video games have always been more than
        just an enjoying spare time activity when I want to simply have fun but
        also it's also done a great job with helping me unwind and destress
        (being an adult can have its moments so a break from reality never hurts
        every now and then).

      <h3>Fitness</h3>
      <p>
        Over the years like many adults I've let myself go in the physical sense
        to the point where my health did take a bit of a hit. I found myself in
        a tough spot in life and I had to take control of my life before my
        situation worsened so I got serious about being more physically active.
        Strength training, engaging in cardio related activities, and other
        forms of physicl activity that aided in helping me not only cut down my
        weight but also helping me build discipline has helped me view life
        through different lenses.
