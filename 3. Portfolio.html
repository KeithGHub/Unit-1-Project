        Here are a few projects I've created when I first started to learn code

      <h3>A Random Number Generator</h3>
      <p>
        I found the concept of RNG interesting. The ability to be able to
        generate a number at random was and still kind of is out of this world
        to me considering a number amount is limitless. It's infinite. So with
        this interest in a RNG I wanted to try my hand at creating one (I coded
        my first RNG using Python).

      <h3>A Calculator</h3>
      <p>
        A calculator to me has always been one of the more handy tools I still
        use to this day but of course the tool was first introduced to me when I
        was introduced to mathematics at a young age. The ability to compute any
        number no matter how large the numberical value may be has always
        fascinated me.
